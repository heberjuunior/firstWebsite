<p></p><p> Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is used to stylize written elements in a markup language just like HTML. It separes the content from the visual presentation of the page and can be thought of as the decoration of the website. It is possible to add and change text and background colors, font families, and the spacing between paragraphs. Also, to create tables, different layouts, adjust images in accordance with the screen being used when accessed and so on…</p>
<p>CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 with the intention of complementing HTML as it was not projected to visually format the webpages but to structure it, and then, CSS comes formatting the aesthetics of them.</p>
<p>Technically, CSS is not mandatory for a website, nevertheless, you would not like to see a web page without it once it would simply look very simple and/or messy for your eyes, leading you to leave the page not long after landing in it.</p>
<br>

<h2>ADVANTAGES OF CSS</h2>
<p>It is not difficult to spot a website with and another without CSS once the visual difference is screaming. Certainly you may have come across a webpage that did not load properly and all that you saw was text in black & blue in a white background. This is simply the HTML being loaded without the formatting/styling  from CSS, being needed to reload the page or change devices if there is any error in the code.</p>
<p>Before CSS, the aesthetics of the pages would be also done in HTML, which would generate massive, messy and repetitive blocks of codes and not being very functional. Then CSS came and enabled developers to separate the content from the styling making it much cleaner to create, edit and troubleshoot specific visual elements  whenever needed. </p>

                <td><p>Styles made this way are loaded each time a site is refreshed, what can lead to longer loading time. Additionally, it cannot be used in different pages, only in one. The advantage of it is that having all that in one page makes it easier to share a style of a visualization.</p></td>
                <td><p>Known to be the most convenient as everything is done externally in a “.css” file which means that all the styling done will be in a separated file applying it to any page desired. It also shortens the loading time.</p></td>
                <td><p>It applies to specific elements that own the tag "style". Each component must  be stylized and for this reason may not be the best or quickest to work with in CSS. However, it can be useful for exemple, to edit a specific element, quickly visualize the changes or if you do not have access to the CSS files.</p></td>
