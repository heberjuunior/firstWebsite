    <p>Javascript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex items in web pages - every time a page shows you something beyond a static information, showing content that is refreshed constantly, interactive maps or 2D/3D animated graphics, etc - there certainly Javascript is involved. It is the third layer of the web technologies followed by HTML and CSS.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>WHAT DOES IT DO?</h2>
    
    <ul><b>Some of the many benefits of using Javascript:</b>
    <br>
    <li>Store useful content in variables: you can request the user for input (such as name, email, etc) and store it in its respective variable.</li>
    <li>Operations using text or “strings” like in programming: an exemple is when you type your name in a website, it shows you a message adding your name to it (“Hi, <i>John</i>! How can I help you?”)</li>
    <li>Execute codes with basis on actions such as a click, or keyboard input: when clicking on a link that says “Show More” and suddenly the text opens up in the same page instantly.</li>
    <li>And much… much more!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How about trying JavaScript in practice? </h2>
<div class="js">
<p id="demo">JavaScript can change HTML content.</p>

<button class="btn" type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript! :D"'>CLICK ME</button><br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<p>JavaScript can change HTML attribute values.</p>

<p>In this case JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an image.</p>

<button class="btn" onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='images/pic_bulbon.gif'">Turn on the light</button>

<img id="myImage" src="images/pic_bulboff.gif" style="width:100px">

<button class="btn" onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='images/pic_bulboff.gif'">Turn off the light</button>

</div><br>

    <h2>THE APIs</h2>
    <p>Another great feature from Javascript are the APIs <i>(Application Programming Interfaces)</i>  that provides you superpowers to implement and improve your code. They are codes ready to use to construct parts of a page allowing the developer to implement them in a much easier manner. They could be compared as furniture kits where you buy them disassembled and all that you have to do is assemble them rather than having to make all the measurements and buy the materials etc.</p><br>
