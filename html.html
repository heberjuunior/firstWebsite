    <p> HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i>  is the language basis of the internet. It was developed to be easily understood by humans and also machines or systems such as Google and other search engines that run through the internet gathering information.
    </p><br>

     <h2> WHO CREATED IT?</h2>
    <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee, a computer scientist from England wrote the first version of HTML in 1993. Since then, many versions of it were created and the most popular and the one that became standard from 1999 was the version 4.01and it went throughout the 2000’s until HTML 5 used nowadays.
    </p></br>

    <h2>WHAT ARE THE TAGS?</h2>
    <p>As the name suggests (Hypertext Markup Language), HTML is a language of marking elements to show the information the web page will display. For instance, the important title, the tittle of the article, or news that is shown on the tab of the browser, that element is marked with a tag/element which is called H1.</p>
    <p>    Making use of these tags, the browser will better understand what each piece of information means and therefore, treating it accordingly. A title, a paragraph, a button, a form or table, etc. We also describe what is what so that systems such as Google can easily find and show these data in research more easily, showing data from a title or a paragraph with basis on the tag usage. 
    </p></br>

    <h2> BASIC STRUCTURE</h2>

       <p> The first line is called <i>DOCTYPE</i> -- it warns the browsers, search engines, screen readers among others what kind of document they are about to load. There are other codes that could be loaded such as XML <i>(Extensible Markup Language)</i>. For this reason, DOCTYPE shows the browser how to behave/read the information to be shown to the user.`</p>
    <p>        Then, comes the HTML Tag which means that everything between these tags are written in HTML. Along with it there is an <i>ATTRIBUTE</i> “lang” which indicates the language that text is written in.
    </p><p>     Right after the html tag there comes another tag such as "title" between tags that indicates to the browser that whatever is in there will be displayed on top of the tab as also for the research and rendering..
    body tags marks the content of the website, all paragraphs, images etc. must be inserted inside these tags building then, the structural part of the website.
